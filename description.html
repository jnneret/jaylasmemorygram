                    <i>Loss of Innocence</i> is a net art project that explores the personal journey of becoming exposed to injustices through the lens of social media. <br> <br> The piece guides users through a visual experience that starts with a nostalgic, innocent interface reflecting childhood pop culture from 2011. As the user scrolls, they encounter a post about activism, injustice, and social change. This transition symbolizes the shift from a carefree innocence to an awareness of the complex realities of the world. <br> <br>
                    Through symbolic design, interface changes, and the use of Pan-African colors, the project evokes the emotional experience of doom scrolling, endlessly scrolling through social media and consuming posts highlighting injustices. <br> <br> The piece is intended to represent the shift in consciousness I experienced as a young child when I first encountered online discourse surrounding the systemic injustice and struggles faced by my community.
                    Rather than using specific names or faces of victims, Loss of Innocence relies on the power of hashtags and visual symbolism tied to Black liberation movements, creating a  experience with  emotional impact. The project uses these symbols to highlight the ongoing struggles without explicitly identifying individual victims. <br> <br>
                    The journey begins on a pink homepage, reminiscent of childhood pop culture, evoking feelings of innocence. The experience takes a turn when the user scrolls and encounters a post about a protest, accompanied by a flashing hashtag #NotOneMore. This moment marks the first exposure to a cause that demands attention. Clicking on the hashtag leads to a black page filled with Pan-African colored floating hashtags, including #NotOneMore #NoJusticeNoPeace and #EnoughIsEnough. 
                    Users can interact with the protest page by searching for hashtags, which opens an influx of related posts, further emphasizing the volume these issues. Throughout the site, there is a profile that evolves as the user progresses through the pages. The transformation of the profile symbolizes the journey from innocence to awareness, mirroring how oneâ€™s worldview shifts after being exposed to the injustices.
